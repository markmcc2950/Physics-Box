Difficult to show in images, but the box bounces around the window based on where the user clicks on the screen. The RGB values of the box are changed depending on which surface (top, bottom, left, right) it hits. 

The velocity begins fast, but decreases with each tick, as well as losing a small percentage of energy each time it strikes a wall.

Future plans:

- Add other objects on the window to be modified when struck, or collected
- Fine tune the box movement based on where the user clicks. Currently it's locked into 45° movement. I'd like to get it down to 1° or less.
- Create a more complex scene to bounce around
